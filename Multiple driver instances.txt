Unfortunately, yes that is the hack that must be used to get multiple driver instances.
 
The problem is that the driver’s settings are keyed on the driver’s ProgID, so if you load 
the same driver twice you get two drivers with exactly the same settings, including the serial port, etc. 
Serial ports are singletons so the second instance comes unstuck when it tries to open the serial port.
 
The recommended workaround is to produce two identical drivers that differ only by ProgID, 
which means there has to be two copies of the driver in the Chooser, and so on.
 
Some driver developers have found alternative techniques by ignoring the ASCOM Profile store 
and implementing their own settings mechanism, but that is very driver-specific and as an app developer you can’t rely on it.
